// Ideas for CA 2 

// Requirements
    - Top Down 
    - who moves in response to the arrow keys
    - is chased by enemies


// Personal Requirements
    - Player must chase target
    - Target is running away
    - While being chased by enemy
    - player can kill enemies

// Ideas for Now
    - maybe enemies chase the target and the target constantly moves, player must defend target
    - enemies can kill target + player ( game over )
    - player can kill target ( game over )
    - score is measured by time survived
    - game gets progressively harder

// Setting Ideas
    - set in field?
    - target is a bunny? enemies are foxes?
    - player could be a farmer with a gun?
